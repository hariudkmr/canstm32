# CAN FD

CAN FD (Controller Area Network Flexible Data-Rate) is a communication protocol typically used for broadcasting sensor data and control information on 2 wire interconnections between NODEs. This example demonstrates how to use CAN FD in Infineon's PSoC&trade; 6 and PSoC&trade; 4 MCU devices. 

In this example, the CAN FD Node-1 sends a CAN FD frame to CAN FD-Node-2 on pressing the user button and vice versa. Both the CAN FD NODEs log the received data over UART serial terminal. Each time a CAN FD frame is received, the user LED toggles.

- [PSoC&trade; 62S4 pioneer kit](https://www.infineon.com/cms/en/product/evaluation-boards/cy8ckit-062s4) (`CY8CKIT-062S4`)


## Hardware setup

- This example uses the board's default configuration for `CY8CKIT-041S-MAX` and `CY8CPROTO-062S3-4343W` only. See the kit user guide and schematic to ensure that the board is configured correctly.

    **Note:** `CY8CKIT-062S4` requires rework on the board to work with CAN. (Replace **R124** to **R125** in order to connect P5[1] of the MCU to J4[4]. See [PSoC&trade; 62S4 pioneer kit schematic](https://www.infineon.com/cms/en/product/evaluation-boards/cy8ckit-062s4/#!?fileId=8ac78c8c7d710014017d7153484d2081) for details.)

- This code example requires minimum two kits listed in the 
[Supported kits](#supported-kits-make-variable-target) section. First kit runs this example as it is; the second kit should be programmed with the `USE_CANFD_NODE` macro as "CANFD_NODE_2" in the *main.c* file.

- In addition, each kit from [Supported kits](#supported-kits-make-variable-target) requires a CY8CKIT-026 (CAN and LIN Shield) kit, which acts as the physical layer for each node. 

    **Note**: Here, we have shorted pin 1 & 2 of J20 of CY8CKIT-026 using jumper. See [PSoC&trade; 62S4 pioneer kit schematic](https://www.infineon.com/cms/en/product/evaluation-boards/cy8ckit-062s4/#!?fileId=8ac78c8c7d710014017d7153484d2081) **3.6.4 Power Selection Jumper (J20)** for more details.
   
**Figure 1. CAN FD connections**

![](images/canfd_circuit.png)

- Use jumper wires to establish a connection between CAN FD-NODE-1 and CAN FD-NODE-2. see **Figure 1**.


    1. Connect CAN_RX, CAN_TX pins of the development kits to the respective CY8CKIT-026's CAN_RX and CAN_TX pins.

    2. Connect CAN2_L (J23[1]) pin of NODE-1 and NODE-2 using jumper wires in CY8CKIT-026.

    3. Connect CAN2_H (J23[2]) pin of NODE-1 and NODE-2 using jumper wires in CY8CKIT-026.

    4. In both CY8CKIT-026 kits, connect J1[7] to 5V to power CAN2 transceiver.

- Pin assignments for the NODE-1 and NODE-2 for supported kits can be seen in the **Table 1**.

## Using the code example

Create the project and open it using one of the following:

<details><summary><b>In Eclipse IDE for ModusToolbox&trade; software</b></summary>

1. Click the **New Application** link in the **Quick Panel** (or, use **File** > **New** > **ModusToolbox Application**). This launches the [Project Creator](https://www.infineon.com/dgdl/Infineon-ModusToolbox_Project_Creator_Guide_3-UserManual-v01_00-EN.pdf?fileId=8ac78c8c7d718a49017d99bcabbd31e5&utm_source=cypress&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=202110_globe_en_all_integration-files) tool.

2. Pick a kit supported by the code example from the list shown in the **Project Creator - Choose Board Support Package (BSP)** dialog.

   When you select a supported kit, the example is reconfigured automatically to work with the kit. To work with a different supported kit later, use the [Library Manager](https://www.infineon.com/dgdl/Infineon-ModusToolbox_Library_Manager_User_Guide_3-UserManual-v01_00-EN.pdf?fileId=8ac78c8c7d718a49017d99ab34b831ce&utm_source=cypress&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=202110_globe_en_all_integration-files) to choose the BSP for the supported kit. You can use the Library Manager to select or update the BSP and firmware libraries used in this application. To access the Library Manager, click the link from the **Quick Panel**.

   You can also just start the application creation process again and select a different kit.

   If you want to use the application for a kit not listed here, you may need to update the source files. If the kit does not have the required resources, the application may not work.

3. In the **Project Creator - Select Application** dialog, choose the example by enabling the checkbox.

4. (Optional) Change the suggested **New Application Name**.

5. The **Application(s) Root Path** defaults to the Eclipse workspace which is usually the desired location for the application. If you want to store the application in a different location, you can change the *Application(s) Root Path* value. Applications that share libraries should be in the same root path.

6. Click **Create** to complete the application creation process.

For more details, see the [Eclipse IDE for ModusToolbox&trade; software user guide](https://www.infineon.com/dgdl/Infineon-Eclipse_IDE_for_ModusToolbox_User_Guide_1-UserManual-v01_00-EN.pdf?fileId=8ac78c8c7d718a49017d99bcb86331e8&utm_source=cypress&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=202110_globe_en_all_integration-files) (locally available at *{ModusToolbox&trade; software install directory}/ide_{version}/docs/mt_ide_user_guide.pdf*).

</details>

<details><summary><b>In command-line interface (CLI)</b></summary>

ModusToolbox&trade; software provides the Project Creator as both a GUI tool and the command line tool, "project-creator-cli". The CLI tool can be used to create applications from a CLI terminal or from within batch files or shell scripts. This tool is available in the *{ModusToolbox&trade; software install directory}/tools_{version}/project-creator/* directory.

Use a CLI terminal to invoke the "project-creator-cli" tool. On Windows, use the command line "modus-shell" program provided in the ModusToolbox&trade; software installation instead of a standard Windows command-line application. This shell provides access to all ModusToolbox&trade; software tools. You can access it by typing `modus-shell` in the search box in the Windows menu. In Linux and macOS, you can use any terminal application.

This tool has the following arguments:

Argument | Description | Required/optional
---------|-------------|-----------
`--board-id` | Defined in the `<id>` field of the [BSP](https://github.com/Infineon?q=bsp-manifest&type=&language=&sort=) manifest | Required
`--app-id`   | Defined in the `<id>` field of the [CE](https://github.com/Infineon?q=ce-manifest&type=&language=&sort=) manifest | Required
`--target-dir`| Specify the directory in which the application is to be created if you prefer not to use the default current working directory | Optional
`--user-app-name`| Specify the name of the application if you prefer to have a name other than the example's default name | Optional

<br>

The following example will clone the "[mtb-example-canfd](https://github.com/Infineon/mtb-example-canfd)" application with the desired name "MyCANFD" configured for the *CY8CKIT*-*041S*-*MAX* BSP into the specified working directory, *C:/mtb_projects*:

   ```
   project-creator-cli --board-id CY8CKIT-041S-MAX --app-id mtb-example-canfd --user-app-name MyCANFD --target-dir "C:/mtb_projects"
   ```

**Note:** The project-creator-cli tool uses the `git clone` and `make getlibs` commands to fetch the repository and import the required libraries. For details, see the "Project creator tools" section of the [ModusToolbox&trade; software user guide](https://www.infineon.com/dgdl/Infineon-ModusToolbox_2.4_User_Guide-Software-v01_00-EN.pdf?fileId=8ac78c8c7e7124d1017ed97e72563632&utm_source=cypress&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=202110_globe_en_all_integration-files) (locally available at *{ModusToolbox&trade; software install directory}/docs_{version}/mtb_user_guide.pdf*).

   <details><summary><b>Using Eclipse IDE for ModusToolbox&trade; software</b></summary>

      1. Select the application project in the Project Explorer.

      2. In the **Quick Panel**, scroll down, and click **\<Application Name> Program (KitProg3_MiniProg4)**.
   </details>

   <details><summary><b>Using CLI</b></summary>

     From the terminal, execute the `make program` command to build and program the application using the default toolchain to the default target. The default toolchain and target are specified in the application's Makefile but you can override those values manually:
      ```
      make program TARGET=<BSP> TOOLCHAIN=<toolchain>
      ```

      Example:
      ```
      make program TARGET=CY8CKIT-041S-MAX TOOLCHAIN=GCC_ARM
      ```
   </details>

4. Connect the CAN FD-NODE-2 kit to your PC using the provided USB cable through the KitProg3 USB connector. Open the *main.c* file and set the `USE_CANFD_NODE` macro to `CANFD_NODE_2`, and follow step 3.

5. Open a terminal program and select the KitProg3 COM port. Set the serial port parameters to 8N1 and 115200 baud. 

6. Press SW2 from NODE-1, for transmission of frame from NODE-1 to NODE-2 and vice-versa.

7. Observe the results in the terminal window. You can see the print-logs from both NODEs by opening another instance of the terminal. Figure 2 has a print-logs from both the NODEs.

## Debugging


You can debug the example to step through the code. In the IDE, use the **\<Application Name> Debug (KitProg3_MiniProg4)** configuration in the **Quick Panel**. For details, see the "Program and debug" section in the [Eclipse IDE for ModusToolbox&trade; software user guide](https://www.infineon.com/dgdl/Infineon-Eclipse_IDE_for_ModusToolbox_User_Guide_1-UserManual-v01_00-EN.pdf?fileId=8ac78c8c7d718a49017d99bcb86331e8&utm_source=cypress&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=202110_globe_en_all_integration-files).

## Design and implementation

### CAN FD frame format
ID   - CAN FD identifier;
DLC  - Data length code;
Data - Actual data bytes

 ID  | DLC | Data 
------|------------|------
 0x22 | 0x08 | 0x01 0x02 0x03 0x04 0x05 0x06 0x07 0x08


### Resources and settings

In this code example, The CAN FD block is configured with custom configurations (as it is not configured to work with default bsp configurations). On pressing the user button on any node, the CAN FD frame is sent to the other. The received frame can be viewed in the serial terminal. The USER_LED toggles at the receiver node on proper reception of the CAN FD frame.

**Table 2. Application resources**
